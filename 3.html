<p><a href="https://www.strongfirst.com/" target="_blank" title="strongfirst">Training</a> has always been a passion of mine, actually it’s been more of an obsession. To say that I love to train would be an understatement. I need to train. Despite this obsession, it’s important for me to have a goal or at least an objective.</p><img src="image.jpg"width="100%"><p style="margin-top:50px;">These goals have taken several forms. The specific training for each goal differs, but certain similarities run through all such goals. Of all the challenges I’ve undertaken, training to become a Navy SEAL definitely stands out. BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL) training is some of the most difficult military training in the world. It’s important to train correctly prior to showing up.
